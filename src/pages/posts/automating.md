In todayâ€™s world of web automation, Puppeteer stands out as one of the most powerful tools for headless browser scripting. In this article, we'll explore a practical Puppeteer script that demonstrates how to automate a YouTube search, simulate vision deficiencies, and capture screenshots at multiple stages in the browsing flow.

<h1>ðŸ”§ What the Script Does</h1>
This Node.js script uses Puppeteer to:

Launch a headless Chromium browser.

Navigate to YouTube.

Type a search query into the search box with a simulated typing delay.

Emulate a vision deficiency (blurred vision).

Take screenshots before and after simulating the deficiency.

Click the search button.

Wait for the search results to load.

Take a screenshot of the search results.

<h1>ðŸ§  Key Concepts Demonstrated</h1>

Vision Deficiency Emulation
The script uses page.emulateVisionDeficiency() to simulate how a visually impaired user might experience the site.

<h1>ðŸ§ª Why This Script Is Useful</h1>
This script is a powerful demo of:

âœ…Automated UI testing

âœ…Accessibility testing

âœ…Browser behavior simulation

âœ…Visual regression testing
